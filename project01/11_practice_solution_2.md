 Here are my solutions for Practice Quiz 2 questions:

<b>Question 1</b>: Write a query that creates a table with 4 columns: actor's full name, film title, length of movie, and a column name "filmlen_groups" that classifies movies based on their length. Filmlen_groups should include 4 categories: 1 hour or less, Between 1-2 hours, Between 2-3 hours, More than 3 hours.

```sql
  SELECT full_name, 
         filmtitle,
         filmlen,
         CASE WHEN filmlen <= 60 THEN '1 hour or less'
         WHEN filmlen > 60 AND filmlen <= 120 THEN 'Between 1-2 hours'
         WHEN filmlen > 120 AND filmlen <= 180 THEN 'Between 2-3 hours'
         ELSE 'More than 3 hours' END AS filmlen_groups
  FROM 
      (SELECT a.first_name, 
                 a.last_name,
                 a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name AS full_name,
                 f.title filmtitle, 
                 f.length filmlen
          FROM film_actor fa
          JOIN actor a
          ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
          JOIN film f
          ON f.film_id = fa.film_id) t1
```

<b>Question 2</b>: Write a query you to create a count of movies in each of the 4 filmlen_groups: 1 hour or less, Between 1-2 hours, Between 2-3 hours, More than 3 hours.

```sql
  SELECT    DISTINCT(filmlen_groups),
            COUNT(title) OVER (PARTITION BY filmlen_groups) AS filmcount_bylencat
  FROM  
           (SELECT title,length,
            CASE WHEN length <= 60 THEN '1 hour or less'
            WHEN length > 60 AND length <= 120 THEN 'Between 1-2 hours'
            WHEN length > 120 AND length <= 180 THEN 'Between 2-3 hours'
            ELSE 'More than 3 hours' END AS filmlen_groups
            FROM film ) t1
  ORDER BY  filmlen_groups
```
